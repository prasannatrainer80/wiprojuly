Two-dimensional Array in c#
____________________________

A two-dimensional array consists elements in terms of rows and columns. 

You can declare two dimensional array as 

int[,] x = new int[2,3]; means

x is an array that contains 2 rows and 3 columns. 

Jagged Arrays : 
______________

Jagged arrays consists of multiple arrays as its element. However, unlike multidimensional arrays each array inside jagged array.
int[][] jaggedArray  new int[2][];

[][] -> Represents jagged array

[2][] -> Represents no.of arrays. 

here jagged array can store 2 array elements in that. 

syntax : 
_________

int[][] jaggedArray = new int[2][];

int[] x = new int[]{12,5,22};
int[] y = new int[]{55,11,55};

jaggedArray[0]=x;
jaggedArray[1]=y;

There are 2 types of memories known as 

(i) stack
(ii) heap 

*** value types will be stored in stack memory and reference types will be stored in heap memory ***

static void Main() {
  int n = 5;
  int m = 7;
  show(n,m);
}

void Show(int p, int q) {
  ...
  ...
}

synmbol table, that which contains entire history as passing method, calling method passing parameter variable names (vs) method variable names and allowing copying/sharing values to the variables specified. 

When you declare a string, at first it checks the value is available in heap memory or not (as strings are stored in some part of heap known as *** String Constant Pool ***) as if the value is available, then it points to the same memory location, if the value is not available then it would be stored in different memory location)
