File : A file is a collection of Data, that which allows you to store the output permanently. 

To deal with files, we need the help of System.IO namespace.

FileStream : this class allows you to deal with files. 

FileStream obj = new FileStream(filename,FileMode,FileAccess)

FileModes :
	Create : Used to create a new file, if the file already exists, it overwrites the old contents with new content.

	CreateNew : Used to create new file mandatory.

	Open : Used to open the existing file.

	OpenOrCreate : Used to open the existing file, if the file does not exist, it creates a new file

	Truncate : Used to delete the contents of the file.

	Append : Used to add the content at the end of file. 

FileAccess :

	Read
	Write
	ReadWrite 

StreamReader : Allows you to read text data from the file.

StreamWriter : Used to write data into the file. 


FileStream fs = new FileStream(@"c:/files/demo1.txt",FileMode.Create,
FileAccess.Write);
StreamWrite sw = new StreamWriter(fs);
sw.WriteLine("Hello");
sw.Flush();
fs.Close();
flush() :

Serialization : It is a process of writing the user-defined class objects into the file. 

You can implement Serilization as 

  [Serializable]

To write the data in terms of Object Format we need to use the class
BinaryFormatter

Now, you need to use the Method Serialize 

            BinaryFormatter binformatter = new BinaryFormatter();
            binformatter.Serialize(fs, employ);

Deserialize() : This method allows you to Convert data of file into the C# class specified.
